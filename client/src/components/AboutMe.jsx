      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
      Graduated from St Andrews with a degree in Management.  Resolved not to sell my soul for a corporate job.  Did random jobs for a year.  Eventually sold my soul to Russell Investments/London Stock Exchange and worked in the glamourous world of index analysis. My contract ended and I had to think about what I wanted to do with my life. Started Code Clans intensive 16 week coding course and now coding is what I want to do with my life.
